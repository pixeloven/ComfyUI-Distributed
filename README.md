## Worker Types

<img width="200" align="right" alt="ComfyUI_temp_khvcc_00034_@0 25x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/651e4912-7c23-4e32-bd88-250f5175e129" />

ComfyUI Distributed supports three types of workers:

- **Local Workers** - Additional GPUs on the same machine (auto-configured on first launch)
- **Remote Workers** - GPUs on other computers in your network
- **Cloud Workers** - GPUs hosted on a cloud service like Runpod, accessible via secure tunnels

> For detailed setup instructions, see the [setup guide](/docs/worker-setup-guides.md)

---

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
> Note: Desktop app not currently supported
- Multiple NVIDIA GPUs
> No additional GPUs? Use [Cloud Workers](https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed/blob/main/docs/worker-setup-guides.md#cloud-workers)
- That's it

---

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** into your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed.git
   ```

2. **Restart ComfyUI**
   - If you'll be using remote/cloud workers, add `--enable-cors-header` to your launch arguments on the master

3. Read the [setup guide](/docs/worker-setup-guides.md) for adding workers

## Workflow Examples

### Basic Parallel Generation
Generate multiple images in the time it takes to generate one. Each worker uses a different seed.

![Clipboard Image (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9598c94c-d9b4-4ccf-ab16-a21398220aeb)

> [Download workflow](/workflows/distributed-txt2img.json)

1. Open your ComfyUI workflow
2. Add **Distributed Seed** → connect to sampler's seed
3. Add **Distributed Collector** → after VAE Decode
4. Enable workers in the UI
5. Run the workflow!

### Parallel WAN Generation
Generate multiple videos in the time it takes to generate one. Each worker uses a different seed.

![Clipboard Image (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5382b845-833b-43b7-b238-a91c5579581a)

> [Download workflow](/workflows/distributed-wan.json)

1. Open your WAN ComfyUI workflow
2. Add **Distributed Seed** → connect to sampler's seed
3. Add **Distributed Collector** → after VAE Decode
4. Add **Image Batch Divider** → after Distributed Collector
5. Set the `divide_by` to the number of GPUs you have available
> For example: if you have a master and 2x workers, set it to 3
7. Enable workers in the UI
8. Run the workflow!

### Distributed Image Upscaling
Accelerate Ultimate SD Upscaler by distributing tiles across multiple workers, with speed scaling as you add more GPUs.

![Clipboard Image (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb57a0d-7b75-4497-96d2-875d60865a1a)

> [Download workflow](/workflows/distributed-txt2img.json)

1. Load your image
2. Upscale with ESRGAN or similar
3. Connect to **Ultimate SD Upscale Distributed**
4. Configure tile settings
5. Enable workers for faster processing

### Distributed Video Upscaling
Accelerate Ultimate SD Upscaler by distributing video tiles across multiple workers, with speed scaling as you add more GPUs.

![Video Upscaler workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c3d61b1-0b5f-422e-8c58-7c1555fed765)

> [Download workflow](/workflows/distributed-upscale-video.json)

1. Load your video
2. Optional: upscale with ESRGAN or similar
3. Connect to **Ultimate SD Upscale Distributed**
4. Configure tile settings
5. Use RES4LYF (bong/res2) to get better results
6. Enable workers for faster processing

> You can run this workflow entirely on Runpod with minimal setup. [Check out the guide here.](https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed/blob/main/docs/video-upscaler-runpod-preset.md)

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Does it combine VRAM of multiple GPUs?</summary>
No, it does not combine VRAM of multiple GPUs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it speed up the generation of a single image or video?</summary>
No, it does not speed up the generation of a single image or video. Instead, it enables the generation of more images or videos simultaneously. However, it can speed up the upscaling of a single image when using the Ultimate SD Upscale Distributed feature.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work with the ComfyUI desktop app?</summary>
Currently, it is not compatible with the ComfyUI desktop app.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I combine my RTX 5090 with a GTX 980 to get faster results?</summary>
Yes, you can combine different GPUs, but performance is optimized when using similar GPUs. A significant performance imbalance between GPUs may cause bottlenecks. For upscaling, setting `static_distribution` to `false` allows the faster GPU to handle more processing, which can mitigate some bottlenecks. Note that this setting only applies to upscaling tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does this work with cloud providers?</summary>
Yes, it is compatible with cloud providers. Refer to the setup guides for detailed instructions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I make this work with my Docker setup?</summary>
Yes, it is compatible with Docker setups, but you will need to configure your Docker environment yourself. Unfortunately, assistance with Docker configuration is not provided.
